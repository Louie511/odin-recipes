PROJECT: Recipes

In this project I will be building a webpage consisting of links to different food recipes. 

The goal of this lesson is to test the skills I have learned so far about:


    creating and cloning repositories from github onto my local machine.

    The use of html elements and tags

    and lastly publishing the webpage onto github.
