    <h3>Cheeseburger recipe</h3>
    <p>Anybody who claims the sight of a big juicy cheeseburger doesn't get their blood pumping is either made of stone or a vegetarian!</p>

    <h4>What you need for a great cheeseburger:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>THE BEEF: NO NEED TO GET (TOO) SNOBBY</li>
        <li>THE CHEESE: PROCESSED FOR AUTHENTICITY!</li>
        <li>THE BUN: SOFT AND WHITE</li>
        <li>THE GREEN STUFF AND PICKLED STUFF</li>
        <li>THE SAUCE</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>How to make great cheeseburgers:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Form patties -</strong> Separate the beef into 4 mounds, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers. Gently roll each mound into a ball (not firmly, we want tender patties not rock hard ones!) then press down into a patty that is slightly wider than the burger bun, to factor in cooking shrinkage.</li>
        <li><strong>Cast iron skillet -</strong> Preheat oil in a heavy-based cast iron skillet over high heat until it is very, very hot. Why a cast-iron skillet? Because it's made for high heat fast cooking so we can get a great caramelised dark brown crust without overcooking the inside. This burger patty cooks in 3 minutes flat!</li>
        <li><strong>3-minute cook -</strong> Place 2 or 4 patties in the skillet (depending how many fit) and cook the first side for 1 1/2 minutes, pressing down LIGHTLY with a spatula. Note the emphasis on “lightly”! Nobody likes dense, hard patties where all the juice has been squeezed out during the cooking phase!</li>
        <li><strong>Flip & cheese -</strong> Flip the burgers then immediately top with cheese and cook for another 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the buns</strong> under the grill/broiler for a few minutes until light golden. I only do the cut face because I like to keep the round outside faces soft. Using your BBQ? Just pop them face down straight onto the grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Smear with sauce of choice.</strong> In the photo above I'm using my homemade tomato chutney burger sauce and in the video you'll also see me using my creamy pink Special Burger Sauce. No need to choose - sometimes I use both.</li>
        <li><strong>Lettuce → tomato → patty -</strong> I put lettuce down first because it kind of “sticks” to the sauce followed by tomato then the patty (or patties!)</li>
        <li><strong>Gherkins → onion -</strong> Next, gherkins are scattered across the cheese (they kind of naturally adhere which is nice) followed by onion.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce on lid -</strong> Finally I also usually smear the sauce on the lid though if I'm feeling extra saucy I'll spoon additional sauce straight onto the burger stack instead or (gasp shock horror!) as well. </li>
        <li><strong>Jam the lid on top then demolish your burger!</strong></li>
    </ol>
