        <h4>How to Make Easy Pizza Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below.</li>
            <li>Knead: Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand. If you're new to yeasted doughs, my How to Knead Dough post and video can help with this step.</li>
            <li>Rise: Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Punch & shape: Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
            <li>Top it: Top with favorite pizza toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake: Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
